# Central Ring Project +++ (Business Architecture Edition)

```
🌟 "Not just entities—we're building the connective tissue for decentralized business ecosystems"
```

## Core Business Proposition  
A **flexible entity management platform** that enables:  
1. **Custom Knowledge Graphs** - Define relationships between entities (e.g., "Car" to "Manufacturer" to "Supplier")  
2. **Attribute Monetization** - Premium access to verified/computed attributes  
3. **Collaborative Curation** - Crowdsourced entity enrichment with request/reward mechanics  

## Key Features +++ (Business Value Lens)

### Entity System  
```
🔄 **Value Chain Integration Points:**  
- Entity types act as industry-specific templates (ISO standard-compatible)  
- Attributes support financial/compliance metadata (e.g., `certification_expiry: {type: date, audit_trail: required}`  
```

### Information Request System  
```
💸 **Monetization Pathways:**  
1. Microtransactions for priority requests  
2. API credit system for bulk attribute queries  
3. Bounty programs for community-contributed data  
```
